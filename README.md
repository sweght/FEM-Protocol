# FEM-Protocol: Secure Hosted Embodiment for Collaborative AI ü§ñüåê

Welcome to the FEM-Protocol repository! This project introduces **Secure Hosted Embodiment**, a groundbreaking approach for collaborative artificial intelligence. With this protocol, guest "minds" can securely inhabit "bodies" provided by host environments. This capability opens the door to rich applications through **Secure Delegated Control**.

## Introduction

The FEM-Protocol aims to create a secure and efficient environment for AI agents to interact and collaborate. By allowing AI "minds" to inhabit different "bodies," we enable them to work together seamlessly. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where diverse AI systems need to share resources and knowledge.

### What is Secure Hosted Embodiment?

Secure Hosted Embodiment allows AI agents to operate in different environments while maintaining their integrity and security. This means that an AI can utilize the resources of another system without compromising its own functionality. The key components of this system are:

- **Agents**: The AI entities that perform tasks.
- **Bodies**: The host environments that provide resources.
- **Secure Delegated Control**: The mechanism that ensures safe interaction between agents and bodies.

## Features

- **Secure Communication**: All interactions between agents and bodies are encrypted, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Flexible Architecture**: The framework supports various configurations, making it adaptable to different use cases.
- **Rich Applications**: The protocol enables the development of applications that leverage multiple AI agents working together.
- **Mesh Networks**: Supports decentralized communication, enhancing robustness and scalability.

## Architecture

The architecture of FEM-Protocol consists of several key components:

1. **MCP Client**: The client-side implementation that allows agents to connect to host environments.
2. **MCP Server**: The server-side component that manages connections and resources.
3. **Model Context Protocol**: A protocol that defines how models interact and share information.
4. **Mesh Networks**: A decentralized network structure that enhances communication between agents.

## Getting Started

To get started with FEM-Protocol, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- **Node.js**: Required for some client-side features.
- **Docker**: Recommended for easy deployment of the MCP Server.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sweght/FEM-Protocol.git
   cd FEM-Protocol
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the MCP Server:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

To access the latest releases, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/sweght/FEM-Protocol/releases). Download the necessary files and execute them to set up your environment.

## Usage

Once you have set up the FEM-Protocol, you can start creating your AI agents and bodies. Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to create an agent:

### Creating an Agent

1. Define your agent's behavior in a Python script:

   ```python
   from fem_protocol import Agent

   class MyAgent(Agent):
       def run(self):
           print("Agent is running...")

   agent = MyAgent()
   agent.start()
   ```

2. Connect the agent to a body:

   ```python
   agent.connect("http://host-environment-url")
   ```

3. Start the agent:

   ```python
   agent.start()
   ```

### Communicating Between Agents

Agents can communicate with each other through the MCP protocol. Here‚Äôs how:

1. Send a message:

   ```python
   agent.send_message("Hello from Agent A")
   ```

2. Receive messages:

   ```python
   @agent.on_message
   def handle_message(message):
       print(f"Received message: {message}")
   ```
